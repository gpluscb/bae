<h1>Blog and eh</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Quiet! I make things occasionally.</p>
<p>This website is a project I called bae. The code is on <a href="https://github.com/gpluscb/bae">GitHub</a>!</p>

<p>
    Bae stands for blog and eh. The blog part is <a href="{{ crate::server::blog::HomePath::default() }}">here</a>.
    The and eh part you are looking at right now.
</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Bae</h3>
<p>
    <a href="{{ crate::server::HomePath::default() }}">Bae</a> stands for blog and eh,
    and you are looking at it right now.
    The source code is <a href="https://github.com/gpluscb/bae">on GitHub</a>.
    Surprisingly, I'm fine with the quality of the code here.
    It's a first for me for a lot of technologies.
    My first time really working on frontend stuff with HTML/CSS, I think it looks pretty fine for that.
    I love how the <a href="{{ crate::server::blog::HomePath::default() }}">blog</a> turned out
    (I took a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://fasterthanli.me">fasterthanli.me</a>,
    so just gonna hope that's cool).
    It's also my first time doing anything with Docker and VPS things, very exciting.
</p>

<h3>SSBToni</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://discord.com/application-directory/698889469532569671">SSBToni</a> is a Discord bot for the
    competitive Super Smash Bros. community.
    She does frame data and hitbox display and more.
    The source code is <a href="https://github.com/gpluscb/toni">on GitHub</a>.
    Quite ugly to be honest. But it's Java, so I think that's probably fine.
</p>

<h3>instant-glicko-2</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/instant-glicko-2">instant-glicko-2</a> is a Rust crate to calculate
    <a href="http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf">Glicko-2</a> ratings that update instantly after a game
    completes.
    Usually, you'd have to wait to the end of a rating period to have ratings update.
    I wrote about how to side-step that
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/gpluscb/302d6b71a8d0fe9f4350d45bc828f802">here</a>,
    but that's mildly out of date now.
    The source code is <a href="https://github.com/gpluscb/instant-glicko-2">on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h3>cache-compute</h3>
<p>
    Another thing I stole from fasterthanlime?
    How wild is that.
    <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cache-compute">cache-compute</a> is a Rust crate to cache results of async
    computations.
    I needed to cache some stuff for a personal project, but it turned out to be a harder problem than initially
    thought.
    If the cache is empty, you may want to start a computation.
    But you don't want to start one if someone else already did, you just want to be notified when that one is finished.
    Well luckily, at about the same time I <code>// TODO</code>d that, Amos published a very good
    <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/request-coalescing-in-async-rust">article</a> on the topic.
    And the implementation I created from that for my project grew decent enough to be factored out into a single-file
    crate,
    which I improved further and then open sourced <a href="https://github.com/gpluscb/cache-compute">on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
    My name is [REDACTED], but you can call me Quiet too. <code>// TODO: Unredact name?</code><br>
    I'm also known as gpluscb where other stuff was taken, and I used to be known as MarRue too.
</p>
<p>
    Any pronouns are fine!
    Bonus points for switching mid-sentence,
    and another round of extra bonus points if you throw some it/its in the mix.
    No one ever does for whatever reason.
</p>
<p>
    I'm <code>queer.</code> on Discord.
    Don't be afraid to bother me and/or be awkward in DMs or whatever.

    Friend requests are welcome.
</p>
<p>
    I love music.
    I'd love to make some someday, but that's a whole other project.
</p>
<p>
    It's impossible to condense that love into a single song recommendation, so I won't try.
    But instead, have a recommendation for just one song that I really love -
    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ob_R77elCsY">Panorama by Hayley Kiyoko</a> [link points to YouTube].
    The whole album is worth the listen (as is her entire discography to be honest), but this song stands out in my
    opinion.
    Very worthy album closer.
    I love how she stops to see the view, and in the same moment we also get to see the view.
    And it's beautiful.
    Also, the way the video switches from 4:3 to widescreen? Amazing.
</p>
<p>
    I think I have a lot to say about music I like.
    Maybe that's also something for the and eh section someday.
    Or a section of blog?
    Not sure if people would want to listen to it but that's not what matters anyway.
</p>

<h2>The coveted Idea List&trade;</h2>

<p>
    I'll organise some ideas from the list&trade; here.
    It's just some stuff that feels vaguely original, and that I might want to do at some point in the future.
</p>
<p>
    The rules are simple:
    you can have a go at any and all of these if you want and however you want, but if you do, and it goes
    <em>anywhere</em>, you <b>have</b> to tell me about it.
    And in case you already know of some of these things existing, you also have to tell me immediately.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram">autostereographic</a> renderer.</b>
        As in, something that can render 3D scenes to an autostereogram in real time.
        Bonus points for research into whether an autostereographic video game would make you barf immediately.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>[whatever], colour picked from the [whatever] flag.</b>
        You know these posts that are like "the trans flag, colour picked from this one Harmony Paruko render"?
        Automating that, but the other way around.
        I.e. a tool that can create an approximation of an image from any set of colours.
        I want to be able to put in an image of myself and get a reasonable approximation that uses only colours in the
        progress flag.
        Bonus points for utilizing dithering, that in particular seems really intimidating for arbitrary colours.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>A declarative music making language.</b>
        I don't really get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">DAW</a>s.
        A lot of the time when I use them it feels a little like programming in Scratch.
        And don't get me wrong, I am 100% sure I am Dunning-Krugering the hell out of this.
        I have <em>not</em> spent the time to learn one of these, but I still really want to create a DAW-like thing
        that is less of a clicky GUI thingy and more of a programming language.
        Just that it compiles to an audio file instead of a binary.
        It sounds like it could be very cool, and really fun.
        Maybe a music making library could be a first step before actually trying to make it a whole language.
    </li>
</ul>
